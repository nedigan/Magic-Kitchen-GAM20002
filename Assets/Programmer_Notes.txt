Some notes for the handoff

- Ctr + F search the Project for 'TODO'
I've tried to leave a TODO comment next anything that hasn't been implimented yet

- If you want an Animal to still have a task while it's idle (e.g. return to a waiting area) 
give it a Task with IsIdleTask set to True
Turtles become idle in TurtleReturnOrder.FinishTask()

- added a Window Station that Turtles give orders to and pick dishes up from
(a window btw is the name of the counter between a kitchen front-of-house. put the Station wherever works best for gameplay,
maybe in the Kitchen, or in the Dining Room, or even in its own room)

- Currently the Recipie to use is decided in TurtleReturnOrder.FinishTask() # no its not, but it should be TODO: that
I'm imagining visuals for what orders are being made to be attached to the Window. 
If you also want it earlier, say on a Fox when it sits or on the Turtle when it takes the order, just move that block of code
to an earlier Task. Make sure a copy of the Recipe still reaches the Window though
You may also want to delegate choosing a recipie to some kind of new RecipeManager that can take into account
balance and things

- We're going to need a system for getting new Ingredients, otherwise you will just run out.
Maybe a non-moving Door on the side of the screen that you can attach a Storeroom to to get new Ingredients, 
like a sort of loading-dock
